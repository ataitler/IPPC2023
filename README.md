# Welcome to the 2023 International Probabilistic Planning Competition

The International Probabilistic Planning Competition is organized in the context of the International Conference on Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). It empirically evaluates state-of-the-art planning systems on a number of benchmark problems. The goals of the IPC are to promote planning research, highlight challenges in the planning community and provide new and interesting problems as benchmarks for future research.

Since 2004, probabilistic tracks have been part of the IPC under different names (as the International Probabilistic Planning competition or as part of the uncertainty tracks). After 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2018, the 7th IPPC will be held in 2023 and conclude together with ICAPS, in June 2023, in <**city**> (<**country**>). This time it is organized by Ayal Taitler, Scott Sanner.
