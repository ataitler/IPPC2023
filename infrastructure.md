<h1 style="text-align:center">RDDL and the pyRDDLGym Infrastructure</h1>

The problems in this year's competition will be described in the RDDL language.
RDDL is intended to compactly support the representation of a wide range of relational MDPs and POMDPs and support the efficient simulation of these domains. The domains will be simulated via autogenerating problem simulator and interacted via the standard [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) interface.
Simply put, the pyRDDLSim takes textual problem description in RDDL and generates a gym environment without writing a single line of python code.
