========================================================================

As part of the International Conference on Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2023 in Prague, we will be hosting a novel Planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) track.  Key features and goals of the competition include:

* We will release domains and instances modeled in the RDDL language and provide an OpenAI Gym infrastructure for competitors.
* We aim to introduce novel benchmark domains drawn from fields such as Operations Research, Energy Systems, Transportation, and Recommendation systems.
* Domains will use a mix of discrete and continuous processes, endogenous and exogenous state and action noise, and factorized internal structure.
 
Critically, as a differentiator from other RL competitions, the full RDDL declarative model will be available to competitors to use (if they want).  With this we hope to encourage the RL community to think about how they can leverage explicit model knowledge when available.  Furthermore, we hope to see pure RL, pure planning, and hybrid approaches competing in order to obtain a head-to-head comparison of these different methodologies.

We also invite RDDL domain contributions from the community.  If you are interested in designing a domain for the competition please contact us before November 15, 2022 (ippc2023-rddl@googlegroups.com). An informal email telling us you
want to make a submission is enough; we will then collaborate in adapting the
domains to suit the competition.

More information on the competition can be found at

  https://ataitler.github.io/IPPC2023/

which includes a description of the RDDL modeling language as well as the Python RDDLGym interface and quick install instructions for running the existing sample domains covering 
* Aerial drone control, 
* Mars Rover trajectory and sensor planning, 
* Two-sided recommender systems, 
* Power systems generation, and
* Classical control.

If you have any questions about the competition or participation, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
