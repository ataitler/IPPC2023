<p style="font-size:30px;text-align:center"><b>Welcome to the 2023 International</b></p>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-align:center"><b>Probabilistic Planning Competition</b></p>

The International Probabilistic Planning Competition is organized in the context of the International Conference on Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). It empirically evaluates state-of-the-art planning systems on a number of benchmark problems. The goals of the IPC are to promote planning research, highlight challenges in the planning community and provide new and interesting problems as benchmarks for future research.

Since 2004, probabilistic tracks have been part of the IPC under different names (as the International Probabilistic Planning competition or as part of the uncertainty tracks). After 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2018, the 7th IPPC will be held in 2023 and conclude together with ICAPS, in July 2023, in Prague (Czech Republic). This time it is organized by Ayal Taitler and Scott Sanner.

More information about the infrastructure, how to use it and how to add user defined domains can be found in this short
[Infrastructure guide](/infrastructure.md).


## Domains

There are four domains at the time of the competition call, but more domains will be added, and we strongly encourage the community to create and contribute used defined domains in you field of expertise, or any problem you think the community should try to solve. The highest quality community contributed domains will be selected to be part of the competition's domains. We are aware that participants that submit a domain that is used have some advantage with respect to performance on that domain. We view this as a good incentive for teams to submit high quality proposals.
