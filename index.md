## Welcome to the 2023 International Probabilistic Planning Competition

The International Probabilistic Planning Competition is organized in the context of the International Conference on Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). It empirically evaluates state-of-the-art planning systems on a number of benchmark problems. The goals of the IPC are to promote planning research, highlight challenges in the planning community and provide new and interesting problems as benchmarks for future research.

Since 2004, probabilistic tracks have been part of the IPC under different names (as the International Probabilistic Planning competition or as part of the uncertainty tracks). After 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2018, the 7th IPPC will be held in 2023 and conclude together with ICAPS, in June 2023, in <**city**> (<**country**>). This time it is organized by Ayal Taitler and Scott Sanner.

## Domains
#### **Multi-tank reservoir control**
The reservoir domain represents a network of water tanks interconnected in a DAG structure.
Each tank state is the tank actual water level, which is bounded by zero from bellow and the maximum height of the tank from above. Any excess of water beyond the top of the tank is spilled out and lost. The inflow to the tank is the inflow from other tanks, and stochastic rainfall. The outflow is the stochastic evaporation of water, spill of overflowing water and active release of water to the network.

The incoming water from other tanks is a cumulative sum of all flows to the tank. The outflow is controlled by the release, which defines an absolute amount leaving the tank, which then dispensed equally among the connected tanks. The goal is to keep all the tanks water levels between the minimum and maximum bounds.
