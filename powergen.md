A number of power producers cooperate to meet daily demand that fluctuates according to the maximum temperature on a given day. A cost is incurred for every unit of power produced and income is received for every unit consumed by the demand.
There is a large penalty for failing to meet demand on a given day and there are per-power plant penalties for deviating from the previous day’s production at each plant – some plants must pay higher operating costs for changes in production. Power generation is in integer units, consumption is real, and time steps are assumed to span 24 hours.
